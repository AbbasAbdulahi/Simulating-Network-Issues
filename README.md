# Network Troubleshooting Simulation Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to set up and troubleshoot a basic network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network consists of a **router**, **switch**, and **PCs**. I created intentional misconfigurations in the network (such as incorrect IP addresses, disconnected cables, and duplicate IP addresses) to simulate real-world issues. The goal was to practice troubleshooting using network tools like **ping**  and **ipconfig**.

This project showcases key skills for an **IT Service Desk** role, including network configuration, issue diagnosis, and problem resolution.

## Objective

- Set up a basic network topology with **Router**, **Switch**, and **PCs**.
- Simulate common network issues:
  - Incorrect IP configurations
  - Physical disconnections (cable issues)
  - Duplicate IP addresses
- Troubleshoot and resolve the issues using basic network commands:
  - `ping`
  - `ipconfig`

## Features

- **Network Topology**: 
  - Router with two interfaces 
  - Switch connecting three PCs 
  
- **Simulation of Issues**:
  - Misconfigured IP address on **PC1**
  - Physical disconnection between **Router** and **Switch**
  - Duplicate IP address conflict between **PC2** and **PC3**

- **Troubleshooting Techniques**:
  - Using `ping` to check connectivity
  - Checking and correcting IP configurations with `ipconfig`
